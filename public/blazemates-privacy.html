      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Account information:</strong> Email address and password are
          collected by our authentication provider (Supabase) so we can create and
          secure your account.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Profile details you share:</strong> Name, age, bio, preferred
          strain, consumption style, interests, and other profile fields
          you fill out or edit in the app.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Photos:</strong> Profile images you upload, capture with the
          in-app camera, or store as pending uploads.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chat and community content:</strong> Messages you send, group discussions,
          event RSVPs, and community posts so we can show your conversations and
          connections with other members.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Device storage caches:</strong> The mobile app stores copies of
          your session tokens and profile information in AsyncStorage so you stay
          signed in and your profile loads quickly offline.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Location access:</strong> If you enable location permissions we
          only use your device location to display maps and help you discover nearby
          events and community members. We do not store your precise location on our servers.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section class="section" id="usage">
      <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Authenticate you, keep your session active, and protect your account.</li>
        <li>Build your profile, show it to other community members, and facilitate connections.</li>
        <li>Power in-app chat, group discussions, events, and avatar storage.</li>
        <li>Sync profile updates across devices and let you manage your information.</li>
        <li>Improve reliability and safety, detect abuse, and support customer requests.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="section" id="sharing">
      <h2>How We Share Information</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal information. We share data only with service
        providers that help us run BlazeMates:
      </p>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Supabase:</strong> Provides authentication, database, and storage
          hosting. Supabase stores your account credentials, profile data, chats,
          and profile media on our behalf.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Expo platform services:</strong> The mobile app relies on the
          Expo runtime to request device permissions (camera, photos, location) and
          deliver updates. Expo does not receive your profile content from us.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We may disclose information if required by law, to enforce our policies, or
        to protect the rights, property, or safety of BlazeMates users or others.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="retention">
      <h2>Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>
      <p>
        We keep your account data while you maintain a BlazeMates profile. You can
        delete your account at any time from <em>Settings &gt; Delete Account</em>.
        This triggers our Supabase edge function to remove your authentication
        record, messages, profile row, and stored avatar. You can also email us to
        request deletion. We may retain limited data if required for legal or
        security reasons.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="choices">
      <h2>Your Choices &amp; Rights</h2>
      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Edit your profile details and photos directly in the app.</li>
        <li>
          Manage device permissions (camera, photos, location) through your OS
          settings.
        </li>
        <li>Sign out to clear the local cache or uninstall the app at any time.</li>
        <li>Request account deletion or ask questions by contacting us.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="security">
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        We rely on Supabase security controls, including encrypted connections,
        hashed passwords, and row-level security for database tables. No system is
        perfectly secure, so please use a strong password and contact us if you
        suspect unauthorized activity.

    <section class="section" id="children">
      <h2>Children &amp; Age Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        BlazeMates is for adults 21 years or older. We do not knowingly collect
        information from anyone under 21. If we learn that we have information
        about someone under 21, we will delete it.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="changes">
      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this policy to reflect changes to the app or legal
        requirements. If we make material changes we will notify you in the app or
        by other appropriate means. Continued use of BlazeMates after the update
        becomes effective means you accept the revised policy.
