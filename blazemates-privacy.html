    <p>
      BlazeMates is a social pairing app for adults 21+ who want to connect for
      cannabis-friendly hangs. This notice explains what information we collect,
      how we use it, and the choices you have. By using the app you agree to the
      practices described here.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Account information:</strong> Email address and password are
        collected by our authentication provider (Supabase) so we can create and
        secure your account.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Profile details you share:</strong> Name, age, bio, preferred
        strain, blaze style, what you are looking for, and other profile fields
        you fill out or edit in the app.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Photos:</strong> Profile images you upload, capture with the
        in-app camera, or store as pending uploads.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Match and chat content:</strong> Messages you send, threads that
        are created, and match interactions so we can show your conversations and
        mutual connections.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Device storage caches:</strong> The mobile app stores copies of
        your session tokens and profile information in AsyncStorage so you stay
        signed in and your profile loads quickly offline.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Location access:</strong> If you enable location permissions we
        only use your device location to display the map of nearby hotspots. We
        do not store your precise location on our servers.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Authenticate you, keep your session active, and protect your account.</li>
      <li>Build your profile, show it to other users, and surface compatible matches.</li>
      <li>Power in-app chat, matches, and avatar storage.</li>
      <li>Sync profile updates across devices and let you manage your information.</li>
      <li>Improve reliability and safety, detect abuse, and support customer requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Share Information</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell your personal information. We share data only with service
      providers that help us run BlazeMates:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Supabase:</strong> Provides authentication, database, and storage
        hosting. Supabase stores your account credentials, profile data, chats,
        and profile media on our behalf.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Expo platform services:</strong> The mobile app relies on the
        Expo runtime to request device permissions (camera, photos, location) and
        deliver updates. Expo does not receive your profile content from us.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We may disclose information if required by law, to enforce our policies, or
      to protect the rights, property, or safety of BlazeMates users or others.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      We keep your account data while you maintain a BlazeMates profile. You can
      delete your account at any time from <em>Settings &gt; Delete Account</em>.
      This triggers our Supabase edge function to remove your authentication
      record, messages, profile row, and stored avatar. You can also email us to
      request deletion. We may retain limited data if required for legal or
      security reasons.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Choices & Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Edit your profile details and photos directly in the app.</li>
      <li>
        Manage device permissions (camera, photos, location) through your OS
        settings.
      </li>
      <li>Sign out to clear the local cache or uninstall the app at any time.</li>
      <li>Request account deletion or ask questions by contacting us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We rely on Supabase security controls, including encrypted connections,
      hashed passwords, and row-level security for database tables. No system is
      perfectly secure, so please use a strong password and contact us if you
      suspect unauthorized activity.
    </p>

    <h2>Children & Age Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      BlazeMates is for adults 21 years or older. We do not knowingly collect
      information from anyone under 21. If we learn that we have information
      about someone under 21, we will delete it.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy to reflect changes to the app or legal
      requirements. If we make material changes we will notify you in the app or
      by other appropriate means. Continued use of BlazeMates after the update
      becomes effective means you accept the revised policy.
